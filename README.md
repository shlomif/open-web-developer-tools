(or at least it should not have to be solved three times.)

This aims to be a set of open source (Expat licence) online Web Developer tools
(for conversion and other tasks) written by inspiration from the
[Browserling tools](https://www.browserling.com/tools) which are proprietary
as far as we know.

# Technologies

We use [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript),
[jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery), and some
[GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and
[perl 5](https://www.perl.org/) build and test code.
Contributions in other languages that can compile to JS are welcome, barring
more accessible alternatives.
