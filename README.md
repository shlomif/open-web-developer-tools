(or at least it should not have to be solved three times.)

This aims to be a set of open source (Expat licence) online Web Developer tools
(for conversion and other tasks) written by inspiration from the
[Browserling tools](https://www.browserling.com/tools) which are proprietary
as far as we know.

# Technologies

We use TypeScript, jQuery and some GNU make and perl 5 build and test code.
Contributions in other languages that can compile to JS are welcome, barring
more accessible alternatives.
